**Example: Planning a CLI Todo Manager**

Let's go through an example of planning a CLI tool—a Todo Manager.

**1. Define Project Requirements**

- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Add new tasks with a description and optional due date.
  - List all tasks, optionally filtering by status or due date.
  - Mark tasks as completed.
  - Remove tasks.
  - Persist tasks between sessions.

- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Fast and responsive.
  - User-friendly command-line interface.
  - Data stored locally in a file or database.

**2. Design the High-Level Architecture**

- **Components**:
  - **CLI Interface**: Parses command-line arguments and options.
  - **Task Manager**: Core logic for managing tasks.
  - **Data Storage**: Reads from and writes to persistent storage.
  - **Output Formatter**: Formats task lists for display.

- **Data Flow**:
  - User inputs commands via CLI → CLI Interface parses commands → Task Manager processes commands → Data Storage updates/read → Output Formatter displays results.

**3. Identify Key Rust Concepts to Implement**

- **Ownership and Borrowing**:
  - Manage task data safely between components.
  - Avoid unnecessary data cloning.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Use `Result` and `Option` types to handle I/O errors, parsing errors, etc.
  - Implement custom error types if needed.

- **Concurrency (Optional)**:
  - If adding features like syncing tasks to a remote server, consider asynchronous programming.

- **Generics and Traits**:
  - Define traits for storage backends to allow swapping between file and database storage.

**4. Determine Required Crates**

- **CLI Argument Parsing**:
  - **Crate**: `clap` or `structopt` (now merged into `clap` version 3+).
  - **Functionality**: Simplifies parsing command-line arguments and options.

- **Data Storage**:
  - **Option 1**: Use JSON or YAML files.
    - **Crates**:
      - `serde`: For serialization and deserialization.
      - `serde_json` or `serde_yaml`: For specific formats.
  - **Option 2**: Use a lightweight database.
    - **Crate**: `sled` (embedded key-value store).
  
- **Date and Time Handling**:
  - **Crate**: `chrono` or `time`.
  - **Functionality**: Manage dates and times for due dates.

- **Output Formatting (Optional)**:
  - **Crate**: `termcolor` or `colored`.
  - **Functionality**: Add colors to terminal output for better readability.

- **Error Handling (Optional)**:
  - **Crate**: `thiserror` or `anyhow`.
  - **Functionality**: Simplify error definitions and backtraces.

**5. Plan the Project Structure**

- **Directory Layout**:

  ```
  todo_manager/
  ├── Cargo.toml
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.rs
  │   ├── cli.rs
  │   ├── task.rs
  │   ├── storage.rs
  │   ├── formatter.rs
  │   └── errors.rs
  └── tests/
      └── integration_test.rs
  ```

- **Module Organization**:

  - `main.rs`: Entry point, sets up the application.
  - `cli.rs`: Handles command-line parsing.
  - `task.rs`: Defines the `Task` struct and associated methods.
  - `storage.rs`: Manages data persistence.
  - `formatter.rs`: Formats output for display.
  - `errors.rs`: Defines custom error types.

- **Cargo Configuration** (`Cargo.toml`):

  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "todo_manager"
  version = "0.1.0"
  edition = "2021"

  [dependencies]
  clap = { version = "3.0", features = ["derive"] }
  serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
  serde_json = "1.0"
  chrono = "0.4"
  colored = "2.0"
  thiserror = "1.0"

  [dev-dependencies]
  assert_cmd = "2.0"
  ```
